Fitting Quasi-Periodic Pulsations in Stellar Flares with Gaussian Processes

This project uses Celerite, a scalable method for Gaussian Process regression created by Daniel Foreman-Mackey. For documentation see here: http://celerite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

For a more thorough explanation of Gaussian Processes, see Foreman-Mackey et. al. 2017
